### I successfully install macOS Sonoma on huawei matestation b515 and it works well.The files are coming soon.If are interested in this ,please give me a star so that I will  upload them as soon as possible.


cpu:AMD 4600G
iGPU:ok
mainboard: b550 chipship  
the network:works well  
the wireless:works well but you need a new card  
usb: a typeC port can't work  
opencore:1.0.6(the newest)  

### A quick heads-up: I'm quite busy recently, so the file release might take a little longer than expected.
